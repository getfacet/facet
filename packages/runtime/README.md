# @facet/runtime

The Facet runtime: the event loop that drives stage patches, plus the two
persistence seams — a `StageStore` for the page (always Facet's) and a `Sink`
for the conversation (store, forward, or drop). Both default to in-memory;
file-backed Node references live in `@facet/runtime/node`.

```bash
npm install @facet/runtime @facet/agent @facet/core
```

`FacetRuntime.handle` processes one inbound event per visitor, calls your agent,
and accepts either one result array or an async stream of result batches. Each
batch is folded into the stored session, saved, and delivered before the next
batch is pulled; the `Sink` record is still written once for the whole turn.
Sessions are isolated and serialized per `(agent, visitor)`.
`FacetRuntime.applyMessages` applies an already-produced result (e.g. one that
arrived after the transport's wait ended) through the same queue and salvage.

```ts
import { FacetRuntime } from "@facet/runtime";
import { defineAgent } from "@facet/agent";

const agent = defineAgent(({ event, stage }) => {
  if (event.kind === "visit") {
    stage.say("Welcome!");
  }
});

const runtime = new FacetRuntime({ agentId: "live", agent });

const messages = await runtime.handle({ visitorId: "alice" }, { kind: "visit" });
```
