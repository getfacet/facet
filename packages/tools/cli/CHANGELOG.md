### Minor Changes

- 0d27d03: Hard-cut Facet's style and design-system contract to one agent-friendly model.

  - Every native Brick owns a closed `style` vocabulary: shared-looking target or
    property names on different Bricks are still separate Brick-owned contracts.
    Styles may be omitted, select a same-Brick Preset, use direct semantic token
    names, or combine a Preset with direct overrides. Raw CSS remains Theme-only.
  - One complete per-agent Theme contains concrete token values, Brick defaults,
    and Presets. It cannot be selected from a Facet document. The host-owned
    `colorMode` switches the whole document between Theme light and dark paint.
  - Patterns replace reusable reference trees. They are exact, read-only examples
    with discovery metadata; agents inspect them and then author ordinary Bricks.
  - Agent discovery is progressive and bounded through `get_pattern`,
    `get_preset`, single-Brick `get_brick_spec`, and exact-path
    `get_style_choices`. Authoring errors are structured and atomic so an agent can
    retry, while the renderer still skips only invalid fragments.
  - Assets are exactly `theme.json`, `patterns.json`, and optional
    `initial.tree.json` (or equivalent store fields). The former asset-policy,
    reference-tree, style-selector, subtree-palette, and document-Theme surfaces
    have no compatibility aliases or runtime conversion.

  All in-repo consumers, storage adapters, prompts, tests, and documentation move
  atomically to the new contract.

### Patch Changes

- 4c89b56: Complete the pre-1.0 node-model cutover to one closed vocabulary of 11 native
  bricks: `box`, `text`, `media`, `input`, `richtext`, `table`, `chart`, `list`,
  `keyValue`, `progress`, and `loading`. The six display bricks keep their existing
  rendering and data behavior; only their former component-tier classification is
  removed.

  Breaking: remove the `button`, `form`, `filterBar`, `metric`, `tabs`, `nav`, and
  legacy `stat` node types together with all component unions, registries,
  validators, asset fields, renderer dispatch, tool-executor routes, and prompt
  guidance. Core exposes one fixed Brick roster, and only `box` may have children.
  Stale retired raw nodes blank-degrade in React, core validation drops
  them, and stage tools reject them without throwing.

  Persisted/operator assets must migrate atomically to one complete Theme, one
  Pattern list, and an optional initial tree. Remove retired component policy and
  style-selector keys, and rewrite stored trees and Patterns with the final Bricks
  or box/text/input structures. There is no compatibility mapper; retired nodes in
  trees or references are dropped or invalidate the document at their ordinary
  validation boundary.

  Add validated reference Patterns for actions, forms, filters, bound summary
  values, and local navigation. These examples use ordinary box/text/input trees:
  pressable label boxes for actions, `navigate` plus active-look predicates for
  browser-local navigation and fixed filters, and `text.from` for bound values.
  Pattern reads remain optional and never edit the stage.

  Update the default quickstart tour, LLM prompt, tool-call budget, buffer
  coherence, playground fixtures, documentation, and tests for native-brick-only
  authoring.

- 63fffb5: Add the name-only theme action to the local bridge and CLI surfaces so local
  agents can select validated stage themes.
