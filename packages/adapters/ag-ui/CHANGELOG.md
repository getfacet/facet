# @facet/ag-ui

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9c33de7: Add the optional AG-UI adapter package for Facet's public event edge. The
  adapter maps Facet stage patches into AG-UI state events under `/facet/stage`,
  maps AG-UI text and state events back into Facet's native protocol, and exposes
  browser and server helpers without changing Facet's safe UI tree or RFC 6902
  patch authority. The adapter bounds untrusted AG-UI state payloads before clone,
  keeps server-mediated visitor authorization explicit, and preserves AG-UI
  `RUN_ERROR` SSE bodies for browser transports.
- 0d27d03: Hard-cut Facet's style and design-system contract to one agent-friendly model.

  - Every native Brick owns a closed `style` vocabulary: shared-looking target or
    property names on different Bricks are still separate Brick-owned contracts.
    Styles may be omitted, select a same-Brick Preset, use direct semantic token
    names, or combine a Preset with direct overrides. Raw CSS remains Theme-only.
  - One complete per-agent Theme contains concrete token values, Brick defaults,
    and Presets. It cannot be selected from a Facet document. The host-owned
    `colorMode` switches the whole document between Theme light and dark paint.
  - Patterns replace reusable reference trees. They are exact, read-only examples
    with discovery metadata; agents inspect them and then author ordinary Bricks.
  - Agent discovery is progressive and bounded through `get_pattern`,
    `get_preset`, single-Brick `get_brick_spec`, and exact-path
    `get_style_choices`. Authoring errors are structured and atomic so an agent can
    retry, while the renderer still skips only invalid fragments.
  - Assets are exactly `theme.json`, `patterns.json`, and optional
    `initial.tree.json` (or equivalent store fields). The former asset-policy,
    reference-tree, style-selector, subtree-palette, and document-Theme surfaces
    have no compatibility aliases or runtime conversion.

  All in-repo consumers, storage adapters, prompts, tests, and documentation move
  atomically to the new contract.

- 330e9d9: View-state channel: forwarded events can now carry an optional `view` snapshot
  of the visitor's current browser view-state, so the live agent knows which
  screen they are on. Purely additive and UI-IN inert — the stage document schema
  is unchanged, no new round-trip is added, and `view` provably never reaches a
  stage patch/fold/executor path.

  - `@facet/core`: new `ViewSnapshot`/`Viewport`/`ColorMode` types,
    `VIEWPORTS`/`COLOR_MODES`/`MAX_VIEW_TOGGLED_KEYS`, and the single pure `sanitizeView` bounds
    source; optional `view?` added to every `ClientEvent`/`CollectedEvent`
    variant (forward⊆collected preserved).
  - `@facet/server`: `/event` and `/record` clamp `view` via `sanitizeEventView`
    (calling core `sanitizeView`) without ever rejecting the event for `view`
    reasons.
  - `@facet/react`: `StageRenderer` gains an optional read-only `onViewSnapshot`
    callback plus `captureViewSnapshot`/`useViewportColorMode`/`DeviceClasses`;
    viewport and effective `colorMode` are report-only; only colorMode selects the
    Theme paint branch and neither changes document layout.
  - `@facet/client`: `persistView`/`loadPersistedView` persist the snapshot per
    agent link in `localStorage`, re-validated on read, degrading silently.
  - `@facet/agent-tools`: prompt-kit guidance priming the agent to target the
    visitor's current screen.
  - `@facet/reference-agent`: `describeEvent` renders one inert, escaped `view`
    prompt line (current + revisit).
  - `@facet/ag-ui`: input normalizers pass a clamped `view` through via core
    `sanitizeView` instead of stripping it.
  - `@facet/quickstart`: the built page attaches `view` on send, persists it, and
    seeds the revisit `visit` from storage (report-only, no auto-restore).

### Patch Changes

- 6d19350: Refactor the reference server and AG-UI adapter into focused private modules
  without changing their public APIs or transport behavior.
- cddf444: Consolidate shared event, action, node, and browser-view validation paths,
  align authoring guidance with Facet's closed brick hierarchy, and clean up
  package and test boundaries without changing protocol behavior. Core now exports
  canonical event normalizers, and client exports a shared `withView` helper.
